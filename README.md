## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management can significantly improve the quality of life for patients. This project utilizes machine learning to predict the presence of diabetes in patients based on features such as blood pressure, insulin levels, BMI, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which contains medical records for female patients of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset includes the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic)

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python and pip installed. Then, follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
