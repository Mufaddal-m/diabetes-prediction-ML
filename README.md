## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management can significantly improve the quality of life for patients. This project utilizes machine learning to predict the presence of diabetes in patients based on features such as blood pressure, insulin levels, BMI, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which contains medical records for female patients of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset includes the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic)

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python and pip installed. Then, follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv djangoenv
   djangoenv\Scripts\activate

3. Install required Packages:
   ```sh
   from django.shortcuts import render
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

## Usage

To use the model for prediction, follow these steps:
   
   1.Ensure your environment is set up and all dependencies are installed.
   2.Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided to train the model.
   3.Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Model Training 

The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, and also use decision trees, and SVMs. The training process includes:

   1.Data preprocessing(handling missing values,normalization)
   2.Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
   3.Training multiple models and selection the best one based on performance metrics

## Evaluation

Model evaluation is performed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score.
Cross-validation is used to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Result

The results indicate that the model is effective in predicting diabetes in the given dataset.
